# Zendure SolarFlow [(Deutsche Version hier klicken)](README.md)
This is my attempt to make available my made experiences regarding the integration of the Zendure SolarFlow system, consisting of PV hub ZDSPV1200 and energy storage AB1000, into the home automation ecosystem Home Assistant.
### Integration with Home Assistant
In the next chapter [here](solarflow_eng.md), I will try to describe you how to integrate the SolarFlow system into Home Assistant.
### Use in conjunction with a Hoymiles inverter
For those who own a Hoymiles inverter, have connected it to their PV hub and set it to [OpenDTU](https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU) or [AhoyDTU](https://ahoydtu.de/) for the control and retrieval of the inverter values, you can find my implementation for zero power feed [here](hoymiles_eng.md).
